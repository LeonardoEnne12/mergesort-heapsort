# MergeSort and HeapSort Algorithms in C <h1>

This repository contains implementations of the sorting algorithms MergeSort and HeapSort in the C language. Both algorithms are used to sort integer arrays.

## Content <h2>

### 1. Heapsort.c <h3>
Implementation of the HeapSort sorting algorithm in C. This algorithm uses a data structure called heap to sort the elements.

### 2. Mergesort.c <h3>
Implementation of the MergeSort sorting algorithm in C. MergeSort is a "divide and conquer" type comparison sorting algorithm.

## About <h2>
The algorithms contained in this repository perform the sorting of integer arrays using the HeapSort and MergeSort methods, which are two of the most well-known and studied sorting algorithms in computer science.
